            <h2>Andrew Emanuel</h2>
            <p>My name is Andrew Emanuel. I am the son of my father, servant of my saviour and I wear my family's name as an emblem in declartion 
                of the forces with and against me. Vengeful thoughts consume me as I harbor undeniable  grudge to those who have wronged me. 
                I cannot slumber upon violation of the unjust and iniquitous, leaving my soul tortured to 
                toss and turn until I have exacted judgement upon those that have been possessed by the 
                ungodly and bore rabid fangs of wickedness against me and bathe in the bl*od of the maleficent, not for the sake of or in the name of the Lord, but for the sake
                of the world of the Lord, such that his children may roam amongst lesser evil and entitities of malevolence. השבח לאדוננו

                My interest in Web Development stems from a fascination of certain websites I have visited and have
                long since marvelled at the Aesthetics amd Dynamics of a well designed modern webpage, some of which I would
                like very much to recreate and also learn how to the interface works with a backend to accomplish satisfaction
                for a user.
